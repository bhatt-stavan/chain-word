# Chain Word Game - Documentation

## 📌 Overview
The **Chain Word Game** is a real-time multiplayer word association game where players must submit words that start with the last letter of the previous word. Players have a limited time to respond, and repeated words are not allowed. The last player standing wins.

## 🎯 Scope
- **Real-time multiplayer gameplay** using Supabase Realtime.
- **Turn-based mechanics** with a countdown timer for each player.
- **Word validation** to check for repeated words.
- **Leaderboard & history tracking** to store past games and scores.
- **Mobile-first approach** using React Native (Expo) for cross-platform support.
- **Scalable backend** with Supabase for user authentication and game state management.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Repository Structure
The project will be developed as a **monorepo** using **Turborepo** to manage shared packages efficiently.

### **Why a Monorepo?**
- Easier dependency management across mobile and backend.
- Shared utility functions (e.g., word validation, database interactions).
- Streamlined CI/CD process for deployment.

## 🌐 Best Practices for Game Development
### **1️⃣ Code Quality & Maintainability**
- Follow **MobX state management best practices** to ensure reactivity and clean separation of concerns.
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety.
- Implement **unit tests** for core game logic (e.g., word validation, timer functions).

### **2️⃣ Database & API Best Practices**
- Use **Supabase Postgres** for relational game data.
- Implement **Edge Functions** to handle validation and automate game completion.
- Optimize **Supabase Realtime** for low-latency turn synchronization.

### **3️⃣ Security & Authentication**
- Use **JWT-based authentication** with Supabase Auth.
- Implement **rate-limiting** on API endpoints to prevent abuse.

### **4️⃣ Scalability & Deployment**
- **Frontend**: Deploy React Native Expo app using **EAS (Expo Application Services)**.
- **Backend**: Deploy Supabase backend using **AWS Lambda** (for additional API functions beyond Supabase).
- **Database**: Use **Supabase Postgres**, with automated backups.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate **AWS CloudWatch** for real-time logging and error tracking.

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy
### **Best User Experience When Deploying on AWS**
- **Mobile App:**
  - Deploy via **Expo EAS** for cross-platform support.
  - Use **OTA (Over-the-Air) updates** to push quick fixes without requiring app store approval.
- **Backend:**
  - Use **AWS Lambda** for additional serverless functions.
  - Deploy Supabase backend on **AWS RDS Postgres** for scalability.
  - Implement **CDN (CloudFront) for API responses** to reduce latency.
- **Realtime Sync:**
  - Use **AWS AppSync** as a fallback in case Supabase Realtime has limitations.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Implement **voice input** for word submission.
- Introduce **AI-powered challenges** for solo play.
- Add **social features** (friends list, private game rooms).

## 🏁 Conclusion
This documentation outlines the best practices and technical architecture for developing the **Chain Word Game**. By using a monorepo structure, integrating Supabase for real-time gameplay, and leveraging AWS for scalability, we ensure a **seamless, engaging, and scalable gaming experience**.
